- 👋 Hi, I’m @Simmone-tech (Simmone Cummins). I am currently a teacher and have embarked on a career change mission into cybersecurity.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, particularly GRC, threat and incident response, and penetration testing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of cybersecurity via the Google Certificate in Cybersecurity and (ISC)2 Certified in Cybersecurity certificate. In the future, I am interested in pursuing the CISSP among other certifications that will allow me to add value to the protection of assets, people, and data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other individuals in the cybersecurity space on projects that will benefit our skillsets. The ultimate goal is to become ready to enter into a Cybersecurity professional role.
